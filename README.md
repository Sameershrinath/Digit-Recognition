# **Digit Recognition Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## **Project Structure**

1. **Importing Libraries**: We start by importing the necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
2. **Loading and Splitting Data**: The MNIST dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets.
3. **Data Visualization**: We visualize some of the images from the dataset to understand the data we are working with.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: The images are flattened from 28x28 pixels to a 784-dimensional vector.
5. **Model Building**: We build a simple ANN model with a single hidden layer and train it on the flattened data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on the test data, and predictions are made.
7. **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the performance of the model.
8. **Improving the Model**: We add a hidden layer to the model to improve its accuracy.
9. **Using Keras Flatten Layer**: We use Keras' Flatten layer to simplify the model building process.

## **Results**

The initial model achieved a certain level of accuracy, which was further improved by adding a hidden layer. The confusion matrix and heatmap provide a clear visualization of the model's performance.

## **Future Work**

To further improve the model accuracy, the following steps are in development:

1. **Data Augmentation**: Applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and translation to increase the diversity of the training data.
2. **Regularization**: Implementing regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to find the optimal settings.
4. **Advanced Architectures**: Exploring more advanced neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are known to perform better on image data.
5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to create an ensemble that can potentially improve the overall performance.

## **Conclusion**

This project provides a comprehensive overview of building and training an ANN for digit recognition. By following the steps outlined and implementing the future work suggestions, the model's accuracy can be further improved.
